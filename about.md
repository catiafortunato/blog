<p>I am finishing my master's degree in Biomedical Engineering at IST, in Lisbon, where I am specializing in Biosignals and Medical Imaging devices. I am a technology enthusiast and love problem-solving!</p>
<p>For my master's thesis, I am using deep learning to try to predict neuronal activity based on past activity in zebrafish. I am doing this project in collaboration with the Champalimaud Foundation and my university.</p>
<p>I am founder and organizer of Deep Learning Sessions Lisboa, a meetup group that has the goal of joining people in the field to share knowledge and experiences with everyone that is interested in this technology. </p>
<p>My free time is split between running, reading, and climbing! </p>

<p> I am 3rd year PhD student in the Department of Bioengineering, at Imperial College London. Currently working in neural population interactions to control movements, specificaly between motor cortex and the striatum. <p>
<p>My back ground is in Biomedical Engineering from Instituto Superior T√©cnico, in Lisbon. For my master thesis, I collaborated with Dr. Gonzalo Polavieja at the Champalimaud Research Centre. My project focused on neuron population interaction in zebrafish during spontaneous behaviour. </p>
<p>I am founder and organizer of Deep Learning Sessions Lisboa, a meetup group that has the goal of joining people in the field to share knowledge and experiences with everyone that is interested in this technology. </p>
<p>My free time is split between dancing, climbing, and sailing! </p>
